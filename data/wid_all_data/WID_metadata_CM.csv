Surveys are available for the following years: 1996, 2001, 2007, 2014. Income shares are interpolated linearly when surveys are available at the beginning and at the end of a given period. Inequality series are extrapolated backwards to 1990 and forwards to 2017 by keeping income shares constant when no data is available for these years.
