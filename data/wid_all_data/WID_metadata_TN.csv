Income shares are interpolated linearly when surveys are available at the beginning and at the end of a given period. Inequality series are extrapolated backwards to 1990 and forwards to 2017 by keeping income shares constant when no data is available for these years.

TN;mnninci999;999;i;Tunisia;National income;National income aims to measure the total income available to the residents of a given country. It is equal to the gross domestic product (the total value of goods and services produced on the territory of a given country during a given year), minus fixed capital used in production processes (e.g. replacement of obsolete machines or maintenance of roads) plus the net foreign income earned by residents in the rest of the world.// National income has many limitations, however it is the only income concept that has an internationally agreed definition (established by the United Nations System of National Accounts, see SNA 2008). We thus use it as our reference concept (after corrections to include income hidden in tax havens). // The national economy - in the national accounts sense - includes all domestic sectors, i.e. all entities that are resident of a given country (in the sense of their economic activity), whether they belong to the private sector, the corporate sector, the governement sector.;[National income]=[Net domestic product]+[Net foreign income];Total;Macroeconomic variable (i.e. corresponding to national economy rather than to a given group of individuals).

Surveys are available for the following years: 1985, 1990, 1995, 2000, 2005, 2010, 2015. Income shares are interpolated linearly when surveys are available at the beginning and at the end of a given period. Inequality series are extrapolated backwards to 1990 and forwards to 2017 by keeping income shares constant when no data is available for these years.

The central difference between personal factor income and pre-tax income is the treatment of pensions, which are counted on a contribution basis by factor income and on a distribution basis by pre-tax income.;Pre-tax national income =Pre-tax labor income [total pre-tax income ranking]+Pre-tax capital income [total pre-tax income ranking];Threshold;Percentile (i.e. threshold ) value at pX, whether the percentile is of the form 'pX' or of the form 'pXpY';equal-split adults;The base unit is the individual (rather than the household) but resources are split equally within couples.;Adults;The population is comprised of individuals over age 20.;TND;"[URL][URL_LINK]http://wid.world/document/cgm2019-full-paper/[/URL_LINK][URL_TEXT]Chancel, Cogneau, Gethin & Myczkowski (2019), How large are African Inequalities? Towards Distributional National Accounts in Africa (1990-2017)[/URL_TEXT][/URL];";Figures are obtained by correcting survey tabulations provided by the World Bank (PovcalNet) to account for conceptual discrepancies and the underrepresentation of top incomes. Surveys are available for the following years: 1985, 1990, 1995, 2000, 2005, 2010, 2015. Income shares are interpolated linearly when surveys are available at the beginning and at the end of a given period. Inequality series are extrapolated backwards to 1990 and forwards to 2017 by keeping income shares constant when no data is available for these years.
